# Projects
This repository contains a collection of data analysis and machine learning projects, primarily using datasets sourced from Kaggle.
Electric Vehicle Population was my first project, where I began learning how to explore, analyze, and visualize datasets using Python.
House Rent Prediction was inspired by a Kaggle competition focused on applying machine learning to predict rental prices. I collected and worked with a house rent dataset to dive deeper into model building and explore how different algorithms perform on real-world data. After gaining hands-on experience, I plan to revisit the EV dataset to apply predictive modeling techniques.
Sephora Product Reviews features one of the largest datasets Iâ€™ve worked with so far. Although it hasn't been fully explored in previous versions, I downloaded it to practice large-scale data visualization and analysis.
I enjoy working on multiple projects simultaneously, as it allows me to transfer knowledge and insights from one domain to another. Tackling diverse challenges in parallel has significantly accelerated my learning and helped me grow as a data enthusiast.
